## Getting Started

First, install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env` file and connect to a mongo database.
The inside of the file should have the following:

```bash
MONGODB_URI="your mongo db"
```

Finally, run

```bash
npm run build
```

followed by

```bash
npm run start
```

and the project should function.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
